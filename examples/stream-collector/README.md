## Snap Plugin Library for C++: Stream Collector Plugin Example
Here you will find an example plugin that covers the basics for writing a streaming collector plugin.

## Plugin Naming, Files, and Directory
For your streaming collector plugin, create a new repository and name your plugin project using the following format:

>snap-plugin-[plugin-type]-[plugin-name]

For example:
>snap-plugin-stream-collector-rando

Proposed files and directory structure:  
```
snap-plugin-[plugin-type]-[plugin-name]
 |--src
  |--[plugin-name].cc  
  |--[plugin-name]_test.cc  
```

For example:
```
snap-plugin-streaming-collector-rando
 |--src
  |--rando.cc  
  |--rando_test.cc  
```

## Interface methods

In order to write a plugin for Snap, it is necessary to define a few methods to satisfy the appropriate interfaces. These interfaces must be defined for a stream-collector plugin:

```cpp
/**
 * The interface for a collector plugin.
 * A Collector is the source.
 * It is responsible for collecting metrics in the Snap pipeline.
 */
class StreamCollectorInterface : public PluginInterface {
public:
    Type GetType() const final;
    StreamCollectorInterface* IsStreamCollector() final;

    void SetMaxCollectDuration(std::chrono::seconds maxCollectDuration) {
        _max_collect_duration = maxCollectDuration;
    }
    void SetMaxCollectDuration(int64_t maxCollectDuration) {
        _max_collect_duration = std::chrono::seconds(maxCollectDuration);
    }
    std::chrono::seconds GetMaxCollectDuration() {
        return _max_collect_duration;
    }

    void SetMaxMetricsBuffer(int64_t maxMetricsBuffer) {
        _max_metrics_buffer = maxMetricsBuffer;
    }
    int64_t GetMaxMetricsBuffer() {
        return _max_metrics_buffer;
    }

    /*
    * (inherited from PluginInterface)
    */
    virtual const ConfigPolicy get_config_policy() = 0;

    virtual std::vector<Metric> get_metric_types(Config cfg) = 0;

    /* StreamMetrics allows the plugin to send/receive metrics on a channel
    * Arguments are (in order):
    *
    * A channel for metrics into the plugin from Snap -- which
    * are the metric types snap is requesting the plugin to collect.
    *
    * A channel for metrics from the plugin to Snap -- the actual
    * collected metrics from the plugin.
    *  
    * A channel for error strings that the library will report to snap
    * as task errors.
    */
    virtual void stream_metrics() = 0;

    virtual std::vector<Plugin::Metric> put_metrics_out() = 0;
    virtual std::string put_err_msg() = 0;
    virtual void get_metrics_in(std::vector<Plugin::Metric> &metsIn) = 0;
    virtual bool put_mets() = 0;
    virtual bool put_err() = 0;
    virtual void set_put_mets(const bool &putMets) = 0;
    virtual void set_put_err(const bool &putErr) = 0;
    virtual void set_context_cancelled(const bool &contextCancelled) = 0;
    virtual bool context_cancelled() = 0;
};
```

The interface is slightly different depending on what type (collector, processor, publisher, or stream-collector) of plugin is being written. Please see other plugin types for more details.

## Starting a plugin

After implementing a type that satisfies one of {collector, processor, publisher, stream-collector} interfaces, all that is left to do is to call the appropriate plugin.start_xxx() with your plugin specific meta options. For example with minimum meta data specified:

```cpp
    Plugin::start_stream_collector(&plg, Meta{Type::StreamCollector, "rando", 1});
```

### Meta options

The available options are defined in [src/snap/plugin.h](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-lib-cpp/tree/master/src/snap/plugin.h). This structure defines default values.
Plugin developer needs to define only plugin Type, name and version.
 
```cpp
/**
 * Meta is the metadata about the plugin.
 */
struct Meta final {
 public:
  Meta(Type type, std::string name, int version);

  Type type;
  std::string name;
  int version;

  /**
   * The RpcType in use, defaults to RpcType::GRPC. There should be no need to change
   * it.
   */
  RpcType rpc_type;

  /**
   * concurrency_count is the max number of concurrent calls the plugin
   * should take.  For example:
   * If there are 5 tasks using the plugin and its concurrency count is 2,
   * snapteld will keep 3 plugin instances running.
   * Using concurrency_count overwrites the default value of (5).
   */
  int concurrency_count;

  /**
   * exclusive == true results in a single instance of the plugin running
   * regardless of the number of tasks using the plugin.
   * Using exclusive overwrites the default value of (false).
   */
  bool exclusive;
  /**
   * snapteld caches metrics on the daemon side for a default of 500ms.
   * CacheTTL overwrites the default value of (500ms).
   */
  std::chrono::milliseconds cache_ttl;

  /**
   * Strategy will override the routing strategy this plugin requires.
   * The default routing strategy is Least Recently Used.
   * Strategy overwrites the default value of (LRU).
   */
  Strategy strategy;
};
```

An example using some arbitrary values:

```cpp
    Rando plg = Rando();
    Meta meta = Meta{Type::Collector, "rando", 1};
    meta.exclusive = true;
    Plugin::start_collector(&plg, meta);
```

## Testing

Official Snap plugins differentiate tests by scope into "small", "medium" and "large".
That's also the strategy recommended for plugins developed using this library. For testing reference see the [Snap Testing Guidelines](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-guidelines). To test your plugin with Snap you will need to have [Snap](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap) installed, check out these docs for [Snap setup details](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/BUILD_AND_TEST.md#getting-started), keeping in mind it's targeting Go based plugins.
For C++ plugins test development consider using [Google Test framework](https://github.com/google/googletest), which was selected to test this library itself.

## Ready to Share
You've made a plugin! Now it's time to share it. Create a release by following these [steps](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). We recommend that your release version match your plugin version, as set in Plugin::Meta.

Don't forget to announce your plugin release on [slack](https://intelsdi-x.herokuapp.com/) and get your plugin added to the [Plugin Catalog](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/PLUGIN_CATALOG.md)!
